title: A bash.org Revival
---

`bash.org` was a collection of classic quotes sourced from IRC channels and an important archive of online culture. Unfortunately, after sixteen years, it went offline without warning in July 2023.

This is a recreation of the original site with a small amount of added visual flair but maintaining the same simple design principles as the original, with the goal of preserving this part of our collective online culture for the future in a way resilient enough to last for at least another sixteen years. An attempt has been made to replicate all of the features of the original site, with the major exception that it is now read-only to ensure that the original is maintained as it was.
