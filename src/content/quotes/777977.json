        "<Anonymous> Now, I\u0092m sure many of you have encountered little shits in supermarkets. Little kids running about and knocking things over, being rude, walking all over their parents, you know the kind. But the worst are the biters. Yes, those little cunts that feel it is okay to bite you whenever they feel like it.",
        "<Anonymous> Okay, here\u0092s the best part. A biter got me today when I was grocery stopping. He broke the fucking skin, too. This was when the gears started turning, the moment I saw a tiny sprickle of blood on the little shit\u0092s teeth as he was grinning at me like the little cunt he is. I made my eyes get wide, and started screaming \u0093SHIT! SHIT!.\u0094 Now, my good friend, Tom we\u0092ll call him, was there too, and he instantly picked up on it. He started shouting \u0093FUCK! MAYBE HE DIDN\u0092T GET IT! FUCK!.\u0094 By now, the kid is scared shitless and starts crying, and instantly, Mizz Mom appears out of nowhere and starts getting pissy at us for yelling at her kid.",
        "<Anonymous> Here\u0092s the kicker, I look her straight in the eye and say, \u0093Mam, get your son tested as soon as possible, he just bit me and I\u0092m\u0085 I\u0092m FUCKING HIV POSITIVE.\u0094",
        "<Anonymous> And now there is silence. Not a peep in the entire store. The brat knows he just fucked up big time because his mom isn\u0092t defending his ass. She just stares at me wide eyed. I walk away from them, buy my shit from the wide eyed cashier, all the while blood is dripping from my calf, making a nice little trail on the floor. And, just s we leave, we start to hear the mother sobbing. Sobbing like the cunt she is.",
        "<Anonymous> I have never felt any more satisfaction than the moment I heard that sob."
